### Demo Site for ASU Webpage
Hey, this website is a demo for ASU webpages, and tries to reproduce the given page.
HTML5 is avoided, and the page should work fine on IE8+, Chrome 2+ and Firefox 4+.
I have tested it on Firefox and Chrome, but not on IE due to lack of a Windows machine.
However, it should run fine on IE 8+ as most of the features used here are supported (including media queries).
